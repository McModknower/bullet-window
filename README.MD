* Bullet-Window

This is mostly a c++ port of the cram [cl-bullet-vis](https://github.com/cram2/cram/tree/master/cram_3d_world/cl_bullet_vis) code. Because of that, this code is licensed under the same 3-clause BSD License. The full license can be found in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

Feel free to point out any problems as I am not that experienced in c++ development.
